# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes risk based on key health indicators. The model uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and applies a **Random Forest Classifier**, achieving high accuracy and balanced predictions. The goal is to aid early diagnosis and reduce reliance on costly traditional clinical methods.
